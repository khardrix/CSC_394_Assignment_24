Assn#24 Display a gallery of Flickr photos

In this exercise, you’ll create an application that displays the photos with a specific
tag for a specific user. You’ll also use the Lightbox plugin to display a larger
version of a photo when it’s clicked. When you’re done, the page should look like
this:


1. You’ll find the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for this application in this
folder:
exercises_extra\ch12\flickr_gallery\
2. Review the HTML file to see that it includes a link element for the Lightbox CSS file
and a script element for the Lightbox JavaScript file. It also includes a div
element with the id “new_building” where the photo gallery will be displayed.
3. Within the ready event handler for the document, declare a variable to store the URL
for the Flickr feed. The URL should be for the user with the id “82407828@N07”
and the tag “vectacorpbuilding”, and the return formatshould be set to JSON.
4. Add code to get the data from the feed. For each item that’s returned, add an img
element for the photo to the gallery.
5. Enhance the code for the photo gallery so each photo is wrapped in an <a>
element that provides for displaying the photo in a Lightbox. All of the photos
should be treated as a group.
